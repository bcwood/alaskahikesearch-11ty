This is not a park. It is the huge glacial valley situated north of Anchorage extending west and ending at the Matanuska Glacier, which in its heyday covered this entire region. There are a multitude of lakes which is why many Anchorage residents have weekend getaway cabins in this area. I'm sure I'll get many emails from the natives up here due to the fact that I'm including many hikes in this region that stretch the defined area of what is considered the "Matsu" Valley. But due to the fact that it's mainly comprised of small recreation areas off the Glenn and Parks Highway, I really couldn't think of a better way to group them. And it is beyond the scope of this site to go into detail concerning every one.   

However, there are two notable areas I do want to mention. The first is Hatcher's Pass, an old mining area that is rich in history as well as some very worthwhile hiking. A rough but serviceable road goes over the mountain pass and it makes a great scenic drive.   

The second is the Chickaloon area. I mention this because there is not a lot of details in the guidebooks on the hikes and trails in this area but it is arguably the prettiest part of the Chugach and Talkeetna Mountains. So far, I've explored Nelchina Valley and I plan on really getting to know the area in the coming years. If anyone can help me, please proceed immediately to Submit Hike. Thanks!
