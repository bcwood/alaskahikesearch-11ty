This area covers the eastern section of the Kenai Peninsula starting near the end of Turnagain Arm to the city limits of Seward, as well much of the coastline and area of Prince William Sound east to Valdez. The main part of the Seward Highway runs through it and this site is mainly concerned with the trails off and near the highway. Most of the trails in this area are valley hikes through aspen and spruce, with some trails gently sloping up to tree line and above. This area probably has the easiest hikes due to their slowly increasing elevations as opposed to sharp climbs. A number of trails have 2 trailheads for through hiking, so if you have 2 cars available, you may want to take advantage of not having to repeat the same scenery. Most of the hikes run alongside creeks and rivers if you are inclined to fish. Be aware that since there are a lot of rivers with salmon runs, your chance of seeing bear in this section of the Kenai Peninsula runs high.
