Don't let the fact that this park borders Anchorage steer you away from this magical place. You may be close to Anchorage, but believe me, you are in gorgeous wilderness when hiking these trails. As a guy from back East, I appreciate the wide open spaces above treeline when I'm hiking in this area. After a couple of summers here, I realized that it was pointless to travel hours to get to scenery that was right in my own backyard. The park is comprised mostly of deeply cut glacial valleys with plenty of great 360 degree views. There is an incredible amount of wildlife here with plenty of moose, bear, coyotes, dall sheep, and even the occasional wolverine. If your trip up here inhibits you going far from Anchorage or if you are looking for a great overnighter, this is definitely the place.
