title: Kenai Fjords National Park

There are not many trails in this park as most of the land is covered in glaciers and a huge ice field. The park also encompasses the surrounding fjords that the glaciers carved into the Pacific Ocean. Subsequently, the best way to view this area is with an all day boat tour out of Seward. There are many people, if you are so inclined, who explore the fjords in a kayak with a qualified guide. Either way, the scenery is incredible and hopefully you will get the chance to view whales, puffins, sea lions, otters and other marine life.  

Hands down - no contest!: the best day hike in the Kenai is Harding Icefield (see below). If you only do one hike - do this!
