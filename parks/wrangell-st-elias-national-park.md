If you're looking for that truly, no one around, "this is really remote!", kind of backpacking, the Wrangell-St. Elias surpasses even Denali National Park. With just two rough roads going into the park, few amenities or man-made structures, and one of the largest wilderness areas in the world, this is truly an awesome experience. Four mountain ranges meet in this park: The Chugach, Talkeetna, Wrangell, and St. Elias. The park is dominated by Mt. Drum, Sandford, and Wrangell - an active volcano.  

Needless to say, but let's make sure no one misunderstands: you better know what you're doing if you want to explore this area. This is an extremely primitive park and there are not a lot of resources available for a rescue due to an ignorant trekker. Make sure you or someone in your group has the skills necessary to attempt this area.   

One drawback is the money factor. To truly experience this park, it is often necessary to fly by bush plane to your destination, then either get picked up or walk out. Most pilots charge around $300. For the financially challenged, there are great hikes off of Nebesna Road in the northern section of the Park (see below).  

Another drawback for people who live Outside is the planning. There is not a lot of good information out there on where to hike and backpack. However there is one highly good source: *Hiking in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park* by Danny Kost, published in 2000. Not only is this a great guide but I can vouch for Mr. Kost as I had the privilege of working in the same office with him. Danny is one of the Wrangell's number one fans and has not only hiked the area extensively but spends his summers in McCarthy. If the Park is on your short list for major trips up here, I seriously urge you to start with this book.
