I always make it a point of doing at least one backpack trip a year here, usually early in the season. The best part is being able to hike along a beach and view glaciers, eagles, sea lions, otters, and a whole slew of water birds. I usually call this my resort backpack trip because the living is easy. Besides an outhouse and covered picnic areas at the end of the trail, there's nothing like having sand underneath your tent for a good nights sleep. With a toasty fire on the beach, this makes a great place to relieve some worldly stress. Take a day hike to Fort McGilvray for a bit of history and an incredible view. As of 2004 there is now a newly enhanced Alpine trail with excellent views.
