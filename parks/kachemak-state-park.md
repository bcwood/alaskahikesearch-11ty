When I was hiking here, it wound up being the closest I've ever come to ending a backpacking trip in an emergency room. But even with that, it was one of the most incredible backpacking experiences of my life. The terrain is incredibly varied and I urge you to explore this park thoroughly as an option if you are a visitor deciding on a backpacking trip. Trust me, it is a much overlooked gem. While there are many wonderful places in the southern portion (below Halibut Cove), many of the trails are overgrown. The northern portion's trails are better for hiking and the scenery is more visible.   

The park is only accessible by water taxi (a list is of these boats is available at the official website-see below). As such, you are far from help. Be careful and be prepared! Due to the extremes in tides in the area, the "driver" will determine when he can drop and pick you up depending on where and when you want to go. Be prepared that if adverse weather conditions occur, the driver may not be able to pick you up at the designated time. You may even have to stay over one more night. Make sure you have extra food, etc.  

The Lagoon Trail connects the northern part of the park with the southern but there is an extremely deep, cold and fierce glacial river to cross. Plan your trip in either section but not both. If you feel confident, educate yourself about fording rivers.
