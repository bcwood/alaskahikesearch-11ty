title: Captain Cook Recreation Area

This is a very small state recreation area tucked away in the northwest corner of the Kenai Peninsula just above the small town of Nikiski. This entire area is more suited to canoeing enthusiasts as there are numerous lakes with portages in between. If for some reason you are in the area, it is worth an afternoon to check out the beach for its eerie desolate view of the Cook Inlet as well as two of Alaska's most well known volcanoes. Otherwise, there is not that much to the place and it is not really worth the extra time off the main highway.
