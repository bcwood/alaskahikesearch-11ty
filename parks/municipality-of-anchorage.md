I'll be honest with you; as an urban landscape, Anchorage isn't up there for architectural wonder. Most of the buildings and houses are pretty drab and unimaginative. Thankfully, we are compensated for having to view fatal design by being only minutes, and sometimes seconds, away from gorgeous wildlife and scenery. What the city lacks in cityscape more than compensates with its endless trails, parks, and greenbelts intermingled throughout the developments and neighborhoods. No matter where you live or stay in Anchorage, you are close to a place to quietly relax and reduce your stress level. For summer visitors who will be in the city proper for a few days, it is highly recommended that you rent a bike and ride the Coastal Trail. With 20 hours of sunlight, you can find the time- trust me.  

Ironically, I have seen more wildlife on these trails than out in the backcountry.
