Yup! You heard right. What may also surprise you is that you have a better chance of seeing Denali in this state park than in the national park. Even if this hard to miss mountain weren't there, this would still be a great place. The park has great views of the Talkeetna Mountains and the Alaska Range.  

There are 3 rest areas with views of Denali and 3 campgrounds, one an RV park with a spectacular view of the Mountain. The Byers Lake Campground has two cabins for rent. Many people use the lake for fishing, boating, and kayaking. There are also a few hiking trails around the lake.  

However the gems of the park are the several hiking trails that run along the ridge of Kesugi Mountain. They are great trails in themselves, with incredible tundra and rock formations, as well as loads of lakes and tarns. However, the fact that most of the time on these trails, you'll be seeing Denali certainly adds to the flavor.   

Just so you don't say I didn't warn you, due to the weather conditions Denali creates in itself, you will only have a 30% chance of seeing it unobstructed by clouds on any given day.
