Did you go to this one first? If you are an experienced backpacker, you've probably been dreaming of going here for a long time.   

If you're new to backpacking, the first thing you need to know is that this is the real magilla-no trails! (with the exception of a few at the entrance to the park). You are expected to know how to navigate and with only 4 people allowed to a quadrant at any one time, you'd better not expect anybody to help you out in a pinch. Oh, and by the way- this is grizzly country. To drive home the point till you get it into your skull, make sure someone in your team has the wilderness skills it takes to travel in this park.  

If this is the kind of backpacking you're looking for, my website will not be of much help, as I have narrowed the scope to designated trails. I do want to let you know how it works in the park as there is an incredible amount of false information out there.  

The bottom line is to not get too attached to any one area as you will only be able to get the permit to backpack it 24 hours in advance. As stated above, only 4 people are allowed to a quadrant. If someone beats you to the punch, you can either sit around and wait or pick another quadrant. My best advice to you is go into the welcome center and talk with the knowledgeable and extremely friendly rangers and decide where to go based on their advice and what's available.   

You will be expected to view a bear safety video and you will also be given a bear proof container. There are no private vehicles allowed on the road so you will use the bus system to drop you off and pick you up. Busses run roughly every half hour so once you get back to the road after your trip, you won't have to wait that long. Since the busses only go 20 miles an hour and stop frequently for wildlife viewing, make sure you get on an early bus to your destination.  

Whether you backpack or not, it is definitely worthwhile to take the bus tour through the park. Bring food and drink as there are no places to get them once you start the tour. If you're lucky, you will see an incredible amount of wildlife as well as some spectacular views. I recommend the Toklat destination bus. It's 6 hours roundtrip, which is just about how long you'll want to be riding. For those backpacking, taking the bus trip before you plan can give you some great ideas. A hard quadrant to get but would be my first choice would be the Polychrome Mountains.  

Just so you don't say I didn't warn you, due to the weather conditions Denali creates in itself, you will only have a 30% chance of seeing it unobstructed by clouds on any given day.
