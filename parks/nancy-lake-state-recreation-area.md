In the summer, this place is a canoe trail system with short portages between the lakes. There are some trails that don't need portage. In the winter it makes a great getaway when the winter blues get deep. This is on the list with the suggestion that you rent one of its 14 fee cabins and stay the night. The James Cabin will give you the most privacy; the ones on Nancy Lake proper the least.
