This area mainly covers the western section of the Kenai Peninsula. It is mainly flat taiga with numerous lakes, and as such, its primary recreation is suited more toward water activities, especially fishing. Most of the hikes are short trails that end at a lake. Most have trailheads at or near campgrounds. The water in Kenai Lake, Skilak Lake and the Kenai River is gorgeous. These are great hikes if you have very small children.  

The entire Skilak Lake area is a great place to hang out, especially for families. There are several great state campgrounds, easy trails with great views, fishing, lots of wildlife, and some nice scenic overlooks.
