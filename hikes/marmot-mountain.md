I had always wanted to climb this mountain, it always seemed easy from the road. Although it ended up not being too easy, it was certainly not too challenging, and it has some great views. Almost all of the popular Hatcher Pass areas can be seen from the top, so it was quite a sight.

The trailhead is at the Fishhook Winter Trailhead just a couple of miles before the Independence mine area. The hike begins with small rolling hills and increases in steepness. It took me about 1 hour to get to the first peak/ridgeline. Once you get to the ridgeline, it’s an easy stroll to the next ascension to the top where the summit flag is.

Great hike for families, I’d say a 6 year old could probably do this hike fairly easy. Though the parking area can also be seen the entire time, it is a relaxing hike with a secluded feel.

### Finding the Trailhead

From Glenn Highway Milepost 49.5, north on Palmer-Fishhook Road to Hatcher Pass, 13.7 miles on the right;

or George Parks Highway Milepost 36.1, north on Trunk Road to Palmer-Fishhook Road, turn left (north) to Hatcher Pass, 13.7 miles on the right.

### Etc.

There is a $5 parking fee at the bottom. State parking passes are valid.
