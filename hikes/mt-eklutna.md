The trailhead to this route provides access to [Bear Mountain](./bear-mountain) and Mt. Eklutna. You can either climb up and over Bear Mountain and then continue to Mt. Eklutna, or head straight to Mt. Eklutna via the [Peter's Creek Trail](./peters-creek-trail). That trail leads along an old roadbed that can be steep and muddy in sections, then follow it up to the left until you reach the saddle. Mt. Eklutna is the mountain up to the right.

Mt. Eklutna and Bear Mountain, tiered hills above the town of Peters Creek, sit at the tip of a ridge stretching from the heart of the park like emissaries to civilization. The Mt. Eklutna Trail meanders through a lupine-filled meadow, then climbs a sculpted ridge to the summit. When you reach the top of the saddle, follow the trail to the right with mild scrambling until you reach Mt. Eklutna. Bear Mountain is a shorter but less pleasant hike, steep and eroded in some sections. Nevertheless, it sees a steady stream of locals eager to visit the peak towering so dramatically above their community.

### Important Information
