Powerline Pass is basically a beat up dirt service road where the power line crosses over the Chugach Mountains. The main section goes through the Glen Alps where many wonderful hikes can be found (see below). While the scenery along this road is very beautiful, the dirt road and power line can really detract from it. However, it's a great mountain bike trail, and in the winter, a great cross country skiing trail. Going over the actual Pass is quite exhilarating as the trail narrows up a steep ridge.

Many residents on the east side of Anchorage access the lower part of the trail from various trails and moose paths near their homes, but there is no reason for visitors to venture to this part. The best section starts from the Flat Top parking lot. and goes right up to the Pass, where there is a small tarn (lake). As you head toward this section, the terrain gets rockier with less vegetation as you are literally crossing over treeline.

The Pass to the end at the Seward Highway does not get the crowds that the other sections get so head there for more solitude. 

There is a good chance of seeing [moose](http://alaskahikesearch.com/education/#moose) and dall sheep. A few times, I have seen coyotes.

### Important Information

The section of the trail between the Pass and midway to Indian Valley can be quite clogged with snow even into June. Be very careful at the Pass if there is a lot of snow as there is quite a drop if you slip and slide down.

### Etc.

The Glen Alps Parking Lot and the Prospect Heights Parking Lot both require a $5 parking fee (bring exact amount). The price for an annual parking pass is $60. You can purchase a pass at the Federal Building at 4th and F or the Atwood Building on 7th and E, 13th Floor. 

Here are the directions for getting there: take the Seward Highway to the O'Malley exit and head east. After a few miles, follow the signs to Glen Alps. Make a right on Hillside Drive then a left on Upper Huffman. Turn right on Toilsome Hill. This road will twist and wind up the hills for about two miles.
