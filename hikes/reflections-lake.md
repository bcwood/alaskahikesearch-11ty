On the trail, don't pass up Lake Overlook, it provides an awesome view of the lake, benches are there, to relax, and there are some great photo ops.

### Important Information

The lake is clean, but people fish there, so swimming is not recommended :)

### Etc.

No parking fees. Toilets available.

### Finding the Trailhead

Take the Glenn Highway north. Immediately after crossing the Knik River Bridge, the exit will be on the right, then, just follow the signs.
