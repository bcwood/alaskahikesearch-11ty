One of the few actual trails in the park. If you're not going to actually backpack, it's worth the day hike for great views of the park and the main valley. The top has some interesting landscape features to it.

### Important Information

Being one of the few trails, as well as near the hotel, your solitude factor will be pretty low.

You *cannot* see Denali from this peak.

### Etc.

There are many great sources for exploring Denali National Park that are beyond the scope of this page or the website in general. Go to the link in General Vicinity to get you started. 

I recently discovered that there is a guide book for the few trails. It's called *Denali Trails: Guide to Entrance Area Hiking* by Sheri Forbes ([Alaska History Association](http://www.alaskanha.org/), 1992). I'm not sure if it's still in print.
