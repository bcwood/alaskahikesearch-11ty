I hiked/snowshoed this trail with the [Anchorage Adventurers Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/AnchorageAdventurers/) in March 2008. The snow condition is great. You can access the peak from the Ptarmigan Valley Trailhead. The first 4 miles is wide and well packed. Skiing should be great on this trail. The trail leads steady uphill towards a bowl where you can see [Mt. Baldy](/hikes/mt-baldy/), [Black Tail Rock](/hikes/black-tail-rocks/) and other peaks. Round Top Peak is to the left of the bowl. There is no obvious trail to the peak. Just climb up and walk along the ridge about 1.5 miles. The total elevation gain is about 4,500 feet. It is a beautiful trail, and great workout, well worth it. I have to say that I did not make it to the top of the peak but some other people made it.
