Began this hike at the McRoberts Creek Trailhead, then take the left fork and follow the trail up to Lazy Mountain. From Lazy Mtn, I traversed the ridgeline to Matanuska Peak. The trail becomes faint as the approach up Mat Peak begins but the route is straight forward. I came out on the McRoberts trail, which follows the valley floor.

### Important Information

There is a lot of [scree](http://alaskahikesearch.com/education/#scree) on this hike, I would recommend wearing gaiters.
