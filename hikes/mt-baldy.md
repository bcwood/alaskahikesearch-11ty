Baldy is a popular day hike overlooking Eagle River. Baldy is appropriately named; the top is a round, bare mountaintop. The trail starts from a parking lot at the base. A radio antenna is located just a few hundred feet or so from the start of the trail. From there it winds through trees and scrub until it eventually reaches the real base of the mountain. Once above the plant growth, it starts to climb moderately through somewhat rocky terrain. From the top, one can see a good view of Eagle River Valley and the surrounding mountains.

### Important Information

Bug spray is a plus.

The trail can be somewhat muddy early in the season.

### Etc.

Baldy is not only a great day hike, it's the starting point for many other peaks, including Black Tail Rocks, Round Top, and Vista peaks.

### Finding the Trailhead

The trailhead is at the top of Skyline Drive in Eagle River. A new parking area was built in 2009 that can accommodate many more vehicles than previously.
