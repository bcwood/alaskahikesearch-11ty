f you don't have enough time and/or energy to do Wolverine, Near Point is a fine hike to get some good views of the area including Anchorage, the Alaska Range, Denali, Mt. Susitna (Sleeping Lady), Wolverine Peak and Canyon Creek. It makes a great hike right after work if you live in Anchorage. If you're visiting, make the extra effort and hike Wolverine. 

You can also head down the other side of the mountain to Long Lake at the end of the [Campbell Creek Canyon Trails](/hikes/campbell-creek-canyon-trail/ "Campbell Creek Canyon Trail") as well as create a loop hike with Williwaw. 

### Important Information

Bring an adequate supply of water; there are no real sources after the bridge.

There are a whole lot of criss-crossing trails before you get to the Near Point Trail proper from the Prospect Heights Trailhead. You basically want to head down the valley over the bridge, then curve around and back up. You should see the sign on the right a little ways after the Wolverine Trailhead.

### Etc.

The Prospect Heights Parking Lot requires a $5 parking fee (bring exact amount). The price for an annual parking pass is $60. You can purchase a pass at the Federal Building at 4th and F or the Atwood Building on 7th and E, 13th Floor.
