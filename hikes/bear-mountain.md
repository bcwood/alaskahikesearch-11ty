Bear Mountain towers over Mirror Lake in the Peter's Creek area. It is a relatively short but steep hike. The trail sees a steady stream of locals eager to visit the peak towering so dramatically above their community. The peak affords some fantastic views of the surrounding area.

After reaching the summit, you can either come back down the way you came, or continue along the ridge to [Mt. Eklutna](./mt-eklutna), then follow the trail down from that peak to [Peter's Creek Trail](./peters-creek-trail).

### Important Information

There are no water sources on this hike, so plan accordingly.

The parking area is on the wide corner of a switchback in a neighborhood. Please be mindful and courteous to the nearby neighbors.
