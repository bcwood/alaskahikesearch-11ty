This hike takes you up the west ridge of Harp mountain, 5,001' at the head of the South Fork Valley. It is said to be the easiest 5000' peak in the Chugach. It is a steady climb up a moderate slope with an easy to find trail. There is very little scrambling, and it can easily be done in under 3 hours. Spectacular views of both the Hiland and Eagle River valleys await you at the peak.

### Finding the Trailhead

Access is at the very end of Hiland road, with no parking fee. Do not park in the actual circle. Trailhead is at the end of the circle.
