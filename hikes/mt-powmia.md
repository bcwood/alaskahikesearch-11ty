Mount POW/MIA is a mountain that was dedicated in November of 1999 to any military personnel that have ever been determined as a Prisoner of War or been Missing In Action. This mountain can easily be seen from the Matanuska-Susitna Veterans Memorial. There is a plaque for the mountain there as well. It is the largest and tallest living military monument. For more about the history of the mountain visit: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_POW/MIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_POW/MIA)

The route to Mt. POW-MIA is nearly identical to [Gold Star Peak](./gold-star-peak).

This hike is fairly unknown to the general public and can be difficult. The trail starts just after mile 4.5 on Eklutna Lake Road. The closest parking is in a small pullout along the road, specifically at electrical pole 85. From there, you must walk about 1/2 mile further down the road to find the trailhead. There is survey tape marking a steep trail for about the first 1/2 mile. The trail mostly levels out into a field before continuing an uphill climb. Stick to the right as you make your way across the field and continue climbing to the ridge. 

The first summit you will reach is Gold Star Peak. From there, follow the ridge line to the east for about 1/4 mile to reach Mt. POW/MIA. At the summit there is a POW/MIA flag, register, and plaque dedicated to James Wesley Widdis, Jr. Northwest of the summit, about 100 feet, if there is little or no snow, is a picnic table for picnicking pleasure.

### Important Information

Bring any water needed, there is NO water along the trail.

Be prepared for cold weather. The wind can be fierce and VERY cold. Weather can change quickly.
