Gold Star Peak was dedicated in 2018 to honor the families who have lost a loved one while serving in the military. This mountain can easily be seen from the Matanuska-Susitna Veterans Memorial. For more about the history of the mountain visit the [official Gold Star Peak website](https://www.goldstarpeak.org).

The route to Gold Star Peak is nearly identical to [Mt. POW/MIA](./mt-powmia).

This hike is fairly unknown to the general public and can be difficult. The trail starts just after mile 4.5 on Eklutna Lake Road. The closest parking is in a small pullout along the road, specifically at electrical pole 85. From there, you must walk about 1/2 mile further down the road to find the trailhead. There is survey tape marking a steep trail for about the first 1/2 mile. The trail mostly levels out into a field before continuing an uphill climb. Stick to the right as you make your way across the field and continue climbing to the summit. At the summit there is a plaque and other items dedicated to Gold Star families. There is also a tower filled with dog tags left by loved ones who have made the trek to the summit.

From the summit, you can follow the ridge line to the east for about 1/4 mile to reach Mt. POW/MIA.

### Important Information

Bring any water needed, there is NO water along the trail.

Be prepared for cold weather. The wind can be fierce and VERY cold. Weather can change quickly.
