The trail starts at South Rolly Lake Campground Parking Lot. With your back to South Rolly Lake there is a dirt road with a gate. The trail starts just before the gate and to your left. This trail is dry and mostly all forested with a few minor swamps just off the trail.

At the end of the trail at Red Shirt Lake there are primitive campsites. Call ahead to reserve boats at the lake from [Tippecanoe Rentals](http://www.paddlealaska.com/).

Also 4 cabins are available to rent, but in the summer are only accessible by boat. For more info: [http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/cabins/matsu.htm#nlsra](http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/cabins/matsu.htm)

### Important Information

Bring water for the hiking or camping or plan to purify the lake water. This trail is a bit rough for a stroller and rather long for young children unless you plan to stay the night and only if they can handle a 3 mile walk to the lake.

Bug dope is a must.

### Etc.

The campground at South Rolly Lake is really nice and would be a great place to camp and do a day hike to Red Shirt Lake if you are not up to lugging a lot of gear.
Stop at Miller's on the Parks Hwy in Houston for an ice cream cone and ask for the free ice cream with a biscuit on top for Fido.

Parking fee is $5 or use your State Parks sticker.

**Note:** there are numerous entrances into Nancy Lake and it can get quite confusing. Look for the mile markers (you're looking for 67 and then 1/2 mile from there). You want to take the Nancy Lake Park Road, which is just past a log cabin building operation. Do not take the road where the Polaris snow machine shop is.
