The Peter's Creek Trailhead is the starting point for both [Bear Mountain](./bear-mountain) and [Mt. Eklutna](./mt-eklutna), but you can also stay low and follow the trail along the creek. The first few miles of the trail follows along an old roadbed that can be steep and muddy in sections. After that, the trail meanders for many miles up the valley, but mostly peters out after about 6 miles.

### Important Information

This area is popular with hunters, especially in the fall. This also means that animal encounters are somewhat likely during that time. Plan accordingly and be safe.

The parking area is on the wide corner of a switchback in a neighborhood. Please be mindful and courteous to the nearby neighbors.
