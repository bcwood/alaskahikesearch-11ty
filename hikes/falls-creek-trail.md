This is a good early season hike and a great workout. The bottom of the trail is very narrow and wooded with views of the raging Falls Creek as you head up. Toward the top, above tree line, you'll get great views of Turnagain Arm. The trail ends with an alpine lake in a nice glacier carved bowl. It's pretty cool to go from canopied woods into rocky tundra.

If you're a visitor with little time, there are better hikes (like its neighbor McHugh Trail). If you live here, it's definitely worth the time, especially after breakup, when you're going stir crazy.

### Important Information

By a huge boulder, the trail becomes confusing; head left and little ways up.

If you're doing this early in the season, grab some crampons or snowshoes so you can really get up to the lake area and explore.

### Etc.

The small parking lot at the trailhead comes up quickly and is easy to miss. Use the Seward Highway mile markers and prepare to see it at about mile 105.
