The best view of the "horseshoe" shape of the lake is seen from a lookout about a mile in. This was a pleasant & convenient hike, accessed from the visitors center. We saw people of all ages on the trail.

Keep a lookout for the beaver & lodge, which are best seen before you reach the end of the trail!

A beaver dam is at the end of the trail.

### Etc.

*Webmaster's note:* there are 4 trail hikes at the front of the park. Info for this one and [Mt. Healy](http://alaskahikesearch.com/hikes/mt-healy/ "Mt. Healy") are on this site.
