<p>
	The purpose of this page is to give you a feel for the parks and other recreation areas that you may be
	hiking or backpacking in during your trip to Alaska. Please visit the park's official website I have
	provided below for more detailed information.
</p>
<p>
	Please remember that I have only listed parks and/or trails that I have hiked myself or someone has
	submitted to the site. This list should not be considered conclusive nor should you assume that hikes
	not mentioned are not worth your time.
